          <h2>About me</h2>
          <p>Hi, I'm Rafael Ramirez, a student here at thinkful. Recently I've decided to pursue a career in tech. I looked at the many options for tech related careers there are available, from Network Engineer to I.T. support. After deciding I loved the idea of building apps and software and being able to manipulate a computer to do whatever you want with code, I knew I wanted to be a software engineer. I chose to attend Thinkful because they will give me the resources and help I need to be succesful.</p>
          <p>My interests outside of coding include playing guitar and kickboxing.</p>
          <p>I'm more than willing to work with others whether that's designing a new project, or completing code challenges. Feel free to contact me using the links below.</p>
